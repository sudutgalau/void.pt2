<p>Are human beings empty? You wake up in the morning, you fix your hair and your bed. Go to the bathroom and wash your face and brush your teeth. Eat your breakfast. You swiftly leave the house to work or school with your face still blank while passing by a series of human beings who are equally “lifeless”, bombarded by neverending questions like “am I late for work or school?” or “is he cheating on me?” or “do I still have money?” failing to notice that when you woke up, there were birds chirping outside your window, or the sky was exquisitely blue today, or how tasty your breakfast was or how sweet your dream last night was. Sadly, human beings today have been reduced to nothing but empty dolls walking this piece of earth without a definite direction. Nowadays, they prefer to be alone than have someone with them for individual reasons.</p>

<p>Why do we tend to alienate ourselves and blindfold ourselves from the beauty of our world? This is another theme that really hit me. Our world certainly has changed that we now fail to recognize the pretty, little details it has in store for us everyday like the beautiful sunrise in the morning and the crowing of the rooster. Good for me, I don’t forget how these little things make me happy. I always get this dose of nostalgia every time I dream of going back to childhood and the places I’ve been when I was a child. I miss playing post cards and all; or roaming around our barangay playing with other children. In a span of twenty years, I’ve seen how the world has changed. I certainly miss how it used to be. How I used to sweep my elementary classroom’s floor or play badminton under the sun. Gawd, the days…</p>

<p>Are we as empty as an air doll? Well, but there is hope. We all just have to look outside our windows and feel the morning air caress the thinness of our skin; or smile to anyone we meet on the street on our way to work or school.</p>

<p>The world is still…</p>
