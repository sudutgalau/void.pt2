You wake up in the morning, you fix your hair and your bed. Go to the bathroom and wash your face and brush your teeth. Eat your breakfast. You swiftly leave the house to work or school with your face still blank while passing by a series of human beings who are equally “lifeless”, bombarded by neverending questions like “am I late for work or school?” or “is he cheating on me?” or “do I still have money?” failing to notice that when you woke up, there were birds chirping outside your window, or the sky was exquisitely blue today, or how tasty your breakfast was or how sweet your dream last night was. Sadly, human beings today have been reduced to nothing but empty dolls walking this piece of earth without a definite direction. Nowadays, they prefer to be alone than have someone with them for individual reasons.\r\n\r\nWhy do we tend to alienate ourselves and blindfold ourselves from the beauty of our world? This is another theme that really hit me. Our world certainly has changed that we now fail to recognize the pretty, little details it has in store for us everyday like the beautiful sunrise in the morning and the crowing of the rooster. Good for me, I don’t forget how these little things make me happy. I always get this dose of nostalgia every time I dream of going back to childhood and the places I’ve been when I was a child. I miss playing post cards and all; or roaming around our barangay playing with other children. In a span of twenty years, I’ve seen how the world has changed. I certainly miss how it used to be. How I used to sweep my elementary classroom’s floor or play badminton under the sun. Gawd, the days…\r\n\r\nAre we as empty as an air doll? Well, but there is hope. We all just have to look outside our windows and feel the morning air caress the thinness of our skin; or smile to anyone we meet on the street on our way to work or school.\r\n\r\nThe world is still…\r\n\r\n# Composition\r\nWater drops are transparent and serve as tiny fish-eye lenses. These lenses collect light and refract it out across a wide range of angles and can be among the brightest elements in an environment. By taking advantage of water drops’ tendency to refract light and by illuminating collections of drops, vibrant displays can be created. \r\n\r\nTo create the display, we synchronized a projector, a camera, and multiple linear drop-emitter manifolds. The first step is to accurately generate layers of drops. Each layer is created by a linear manifold of emitters, controlled by a single solenoid valve. When the valve is actuated, the manifold emits a row of water drops that freely fall down a vertical plane. The timings of the drop emissions from different manifolds are offset, so that at any instant in time, no two drops occlude each other from the point of view of a projector.\r\n\r\nThe second step is to find the drops’ positions and illuminate them with the correct colors. The camera captures several images of the locations of the falling drops. Based on the detected drop locations, the projector quickly switches images, so that drops from each layer are illuminated with the correct colors.\r\n\r\n### Fluid Mechanics\r\nFluid mechanics is the branch of physics that studies fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest; fluid kinematics, the study of fluids in motion; and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion. It is a branch of continuum mechanics, a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms, that is, it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from a microscopic viewpoint. Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of research with many unsolved or partly solved problems. Fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex, and can best be solved by numerical methods, typically using computers. A modern discipline, called computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems. Particle image velocimetry, an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow, also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow.\r\n\r\n# Project Details\r\nWe present a multi-layered display that uses water drops as voxels. Water drops refract most incident light, making them excellent wide-angle lenses. Each 2D layer of our display can exhibit arbi-trary visual content, creating a layered-depth (2.5D) display. Our system consists of a single projector-camera system and a set of linear drop generator manifolds that are tightly synchronized and controlled using a computer. Following the principles of fluid mechanics, we are able to accurately generate and control drops so that, at any time instant,\r\n\r\n### Approach : Between Cold and Lonely\r\nMetaphors such as icy stare depict social exclusion using cold-related concepts; they are not to be taken literally and certainly do not imply reduced temperature. Two experiments, however, revealed that social exclusion literally feels cold. Experiment 1 found that participants who recalled a social exclusion experience gave lower estimates of room temperature than did participants who recalled an inclusion experience. In Experiment 2, social exclusion was directly induced through an on-line virtual interaction, and participants who were excluded reported greater desire for warm food and drink than did participants who were included. These findings are consistent with the embodied view of cognition and support the notion that social perception involves physical and perceptual content. The psychological experience of coldness not only aids understanding of social interaction, but also is an integral part of the experience of social exclusion.\r\n\r\n_(Chen-Bo Zhong and Geoffrey J.

Based on the detected drop locations, the projector quickly switches images, so that drops from each layer are illuminated with the correct colors.\r\n\r\nBy using a camera, a projector, and several water drop emitter manifolds, we have created a 2.5D water drop display that can be used to show pictures and video based on generative art in realtime\r\n\r\nThe drops are generated in sync with the camera, projector and music, therefore the camera can be used to automatically discover the drop locations. This allows users to easily create content without requiring extensive manual calibration.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
